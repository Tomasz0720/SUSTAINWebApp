## Overview
SUSTAIN is an environmentally-friendly, token-optimized AI wrapper designed to reduce compute costs and increase productivity. By filtering out irrelevant words and phrases from prompts, SUSTAIN minimizes the number of tokens sent to and received from the AI, saving energy and boosting performance.

Our mission is to deliver a sustainable, high-efficiency alternative to major large language models (LLMs) while maintaining powerful AI-driven results.ðŸ”‹

## Why SUSTAIN?

### **Environmental Sustainability**
- Traditional AI systems expend significant energy processing large amounts of token data, much of which is redundant or irrelevant (e.g., greetings, fillers, politeness).
- SUSTAIN significantly reduces token usage, minimizing the carbon footprint of AI queries.
- By promoting shorter, optimized inputs and outputs, SUSTAIN contributes to a greener AI ecosystem.

### **Enhanced Productivity**
- Get results faster with condensed, actionable responses.
- Eliminate unnecessary verbose outputs by default, with the option to expand details when needed.
- Your powerful, straight-to-the-point professional AI assistant.
---

## Features

### **1. Token Optimization Pipeline**
- Preprocesses user prompts to filter out unnecessary words (e.g., "Hello," "Thank you," etc.) and retain only the core intent.
- Example Conversion:  
  - **User Input:** "Hello, could you brainstorm a list of traits a leader might have? Thank you!"  
  - **Optimized Input:** "list traits - leader"

### **2. Short-Form AI Responses**
- Limits responses to concise, actionable outputs using optimized `max_tokens` settings.
- Example Output:
  - **Input:** "Can you list the traits of a leader?" 
    - Refined input: "list traits - leader" 
  - **Output:** "Integrity, vision, empathy, resilience, communication"

### **3. Environmentally-Aware Feedback**
- Track token savings and display eco-friendly metrics to users, e.g., "This request saved 30% of token usage compared to traditional AI!"

## Installation

### **1. Clone the Repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/djleamen/SUSTAIN.git
cd SUSTAINWebApp
```

### **2. Set Up the Server Environment:**
- Navigate to the `server` directory:
  ```bash
  cd server
  ```
- Install dependencies using pip:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- Add your OpenAI API key to an `.env` file in the `server` directory:
  ```
  OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
  ```

### **3. Set Up the Client Environment:**
- Navigate to the `client` directory:
  ```bash
  cd ../client
  ```
- Install dependencies using npm:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

### **4. Run the Application:**
- Start the server:
  ```bash
  cd ../server
  python main.py
  ```
- Start the React client:
  ```bash
  cd ../client
  npm start
  ```

## Running the Chat GUI

To launch the chat GUI where you can interact with SUSTAIN directly:

1. **Ensure you have installed all dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   npm install
   ```

2. **Ensure the SUSTAIN logo is in the right spot:**
   - Place the `sustain_logo.png` file in the `client/src/assets` directory.

3. **Run the main files:**
   - Start the server:
     ```bash
     cd server
     python main.py
     ```
   - Start the React client:
     ```bash
     cd ../client
     npm start
     ```

This will open a browser window where you can input your queries and receive responses from SUSTAIN.

---

## Usage Example in Python
```python
from sustain import SUSTAIN

# Initialize SUSTAIN
sustain = SUSTAIN(api_key="your_openai_api_key")

# Provide a verbose user input
response = sustain.get_response("Hello, could you please brainstorm some key traits a leader should have?")

# Output
print(response)  # Returns a token-efficient response: "Integrity, vision, empathy, resilience"
```

---

## Configuration
SUSTAIN offers flexible configurations to suit different workflows:
- **Max Tokens:** Set the maximum response length.
- **Summarization Level:** Control how much context is trimmed from the user input.

---

## Roadmap
- [x] Implement dynamic summarization based on context length
- [x] Provide additional eco-feedback on overall token savings
- [x] Enhance the GUI with more user-friendly features and customization options
- [x] Add save, clear chat features
- [x] Implement caching for frequently requested queries to reduce API calls
- [ ] Convert to web app and deploy on Azure
- [ ] Convert to Android app
